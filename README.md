Production files for my website geoadaptation.ca

The comments are probably a bit more verbose than necessary, but I had in mind beginners that are starting their journey in the field of coding and GIS.
I'm not a professional software engineer, this is strictly to give a few hints to anyone who would need to create a GIS website for their needs 
without being a professionnal developper.
